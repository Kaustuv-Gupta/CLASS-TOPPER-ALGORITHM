Planning a trip to a vacation site


So the project we have chosen is to work on some real world problem. Suppose one person is planning a trip to a vacation site. He have some limited days. He didnâ€™t want to waste any time by planning by hand or doing some calculations. He knew the name of all the places he is going to visit. So he made an automated system that will take the coordinates of all the places from maps and show him the best possible way to spend his vacation and visit the places.

Data set:
KML file contaiting the details of the places in Kokata.

Implementation
A 10 day trip has been planned we use kmeans and HDBSCAN to make clusters and plot them day wise.
